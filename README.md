4. **Interactive Pivot Tables:** The project employs pivot tables to enable dynamic data analysis, allowing users to filter, sort, and summarize data to gain deeper insights into specific trends and patterns.

5. **Diverse Chart Visualizations:** Various chart types have been implemented, such as line charts to track trends over time, area charts to visualize cumulative data, bar charts to compare performances, pie charts to display proportional distribution, donut charts for additional context, and radar charts to assess course attributes' relative strengths.

6. **Real-Time Data Updates:** The dashboard accommodates real-time or periodic data imports, ensuring that the most current information is available for analysis and decision-making.
